# Rover Autonomous Land Vehicle in a Neural Network with OpenCV

This is the second version of the RALVINN code. It uses OpenCV to read the images from
the BrookStone Rover rather than using Pygame. 

##Status

This is a work in progress by the members of the FAU MCPR Club. You may encounter bugs and
other issues when running this code. 

##Getting Started

Before running the code you will need to make sure that the following python packages have been installed

1) OpenCV 3.0
2) PyPNG
3) PyQrCode and QRTools
4) Pygame

##Connect to Rover 2.0

Open your wifi settings. Finds the Rover SSID, it usually starts with Rover_ROVERID

##To Do List

1) Give the BrookStone Rover 2.0 the ability to read QR codes.
2) Add more helper functions.
3) Fix Bugs!
