#Rover Autonomous Land Vehicle in a Neural Network with OpenCV

This is the second version of the RALVINN code. It uses OpenCV to read the images from
the BrookStone Rover rather than using Pygame. 

##Status

This is a work in progress by the members of the FAU MCPR Club. You may encounter bugs and
other issues when running this code. 

##Getting Started

Before running the code you will need to make sure that the following python packages have been installed

*OpenCV 3.0
*PyPNG
*PyQrCode and QRTools
*Pygame

##Connect to Rover 2.0

Open your wifi settings. Finds the Rover SSID, it usually starts with Rover_ROVERID

##To Do List
*Give the BrookStone Rover 2.0 the ability to read QR codes.
*Add more helper functions.
*Fix Bugs!
